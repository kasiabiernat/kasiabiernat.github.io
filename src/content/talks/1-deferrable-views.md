With the release of Angular 17, a new lazy loading mechanism called Deferrable Views (also known as @defer block) was introduced, opening up new possibilities for performance optimization. During this talk, I presented what the deferred blocks actually are and how we can use them to improve the performance of our application. I analyzed different strategies for triggering deferred blocks, including on-demand loading, loading on scroll, or after a specified time and presented a concrete example of using this functionality in a project.
