It's been almost three years since the launch of ChatGPT changed the way we use technology, learn, work, and communicate on a daily basis. As developers, we now rely on tools like Cursor, Copilot, Juno, and other AI assistants. When solving problems, we often turn to Claude, Gemini, and other language models.

But what if we took it a step further — and used the power of artificial intelligence directly in our applications, offering it to our users?
In this presentation, I'll show how we can use language models (LLMs) to enhance our applications — and how to run them locally or in the cloud, without sending data to OpenAI or other tech giants.

We'll do it all using TypeScript — no need to know Python to start having fun with AI!
